A personal project for OOP practice in Java for me.

Current plan is a small game with player character that
can interact with various NPC's. Player will have an inventory
which will be able to hold custom items.

GameDriver will not be updated for new games/maps. A new Map
is to be provided which contains the map and and NPC's and
locations.

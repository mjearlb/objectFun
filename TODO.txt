- create key for deciding what objects are what (which are passable, which are not)

- Create classes for the wearables (chestplate, pants, boots, weapon)
    ---> ALSO: make Weapon extend wearable(?)
    ---> MAYBE: Change Wearable to not be abstract, add ID's to each
    	 type of Wearable (helmet, chestplate, pants, boots, weapon)
	 instead. Player can only equip one of each type at a time. 

- Create class for money(?) 
    ---> Maybe just make that an int in the Character or Player class


- create new map for different room 
    ---> ALSO: figure out how to make doors work

- Flesh out some NPC's

- learn how to use a HashMap to map NPC's to different tile markers

- Find better way to work with chests. need to allow player to select based on index
       within the chest. Maybe hash coords to the
       ---> Maybe create custom coords object with only r and c to keep track instead
       	    of working with currentCoords so much (annoying)

- Find better way to equip items. Also needs to allow player to select based on index
       within their inventory.
